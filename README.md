<h1>The Project</h1>
<p>So, I wanted to train css creating a login page.</p>
<p>I had never created something like this, so i could learn a lot by creating this</p>
<p>At the start I was using a mix of black and green for the colors, I have a image of the old project, maybe i put it here, but how you can see, I chenged its colors, its buttons, inputs and started learnig about transitions and animations</p>
<p>I had a idea to create a reveal password button, but I didn't know anything about javaScript. So I started searching about how to create one of these buttons, but I just gave up</p>
<p>And now I started a JavaScript course, and already understood those password buttons, and created one</p>
<p>But my website had a big problem, responsivity. Yes, I didn't have much knowledge about this, and again started searching ways to make a responsive website. It was one of the best ideas I ever had. I learned about clamp(), wich is used with font-size, and already saw about min() and max(), that i didn't understand well, but already used in the website</p>
<p>Oh, and i forget to say about Font Awesome, that is reaaly Awesome. I used this in the project and saw how good it is, anyway, I learned more about vw, vh, rem, %, etc...</p>
<p>I think it is all about the project</p>
<p>And i pretend to make it usable, making a login system using sql and whatever it needs</p>
<p>Thank you for reading all of this, good bye :)</p>
